# FlexPythonControl

In Very early development this is a basic interface to send commands to the FlexRadios with the Flex standard API set.
You will have to change the radio's IP in the program.
This is a very simple tool to remotely connect and turn a slice on and off.  more features to follow.  with the end goal of being a usable cleient to connecto to the Flex6K and 8K radios.
